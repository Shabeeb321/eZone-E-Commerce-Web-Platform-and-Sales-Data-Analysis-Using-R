# eZone: E-Commerce Web Platform Development and Sales Data Analysis Using R and Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using R, guided by data science consultant Megan Silvey. The goal is to work through a real-world business scenario for an enterprise tech company, leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights.

The dataset includes:
	•	Orders – Information about customer purchases
	•	Sales Employees – Performance and contribution to sales
	•	Customers – Demographics and buying behavior
	•	Products Purchased – Popularity and sales trends
	•	Customer Payment Statuses – Payment patterns and delays

Through this analysis, we aim to gain valuable business insights, enhance customer understanding, and optimize sales strategies.
